    This project provides a simple implementation of the Blowfish encryption algorithm using Java’s Cryptography Extension (JCE), enabling users to encrypt and decrypt a message within one execution.
📖 Overview

    Generates a 128-bit Blowfish key

    Encrypts user-provided input

    Decrypts the message back to plaintext

    Uses Base64 for readable encrypted output
🛠️ Requirements

    Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
🚀 How to Run

    Compile the Java file.

    Run the program.

    Enter a message when prompted to see the encrypted and decrypted results.
📌 Notes

    The same key is used for both encryption and decryption during execution.

    This is a learning-oriented implementation and not intended for production use.
